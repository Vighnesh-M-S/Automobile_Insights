## 📊 Data Assumptions

-   Data is downloaded manually from the **Vahan Dashboard**.
-   Available only **per financial year** and had to be merged across
    years (2021--2025).\
-   Data represents **monthly vehicle registrations** (not revenue).\
-   Only **registrations per vehicle type** and **registrations per
    manufacturer** are considered.\
-   No direct mapping exists between a manufacturer and its category in
    the downloaded format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Feature Roadmap (Future Work)

-   **Automatic Data Scraping & Collection**\
    Implement a scheduled scraper to fetch and append new monthly data
    automatically.

-   **Correlation between Manufacturer & Vehicle Type**\
    Currently not possible due to lack of detailed data in Vahan.\
    If such granularity becomes available, we can build insights like:\
    *"Which manufacturer dominates which category (2W, 3W, 4W, EV)?"*

-   **Enhanced Investor Insights**\
    Add market share analysis, trend forecasting, and regional breakdown
    (if data available).
